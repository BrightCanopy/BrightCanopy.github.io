We&#8217;ve had some rocky times these last four days (see my [previous post](http://blog.brightcanopy.com/2015/08/08/bad-weather/)), but we&#8217;ve rolled out a different pool of servers and you should now be able to login to Ireland and California again. These new instances are &#8220;on-demand&#8221; so expect it to take a couple of minutes for them to come up the first time.

In other news, we are finally finished with our pre release test. We will not be inviting anyone else to test it out, but you can still sign-up for the Launch at [brightcanopy.com](http://blog.brightcanopy.com).

If you have been using the pre release, please be sure to use up your remaining time and hold-off on buying more time. We will be making an announcement Tuesday about our next steps.

Thanks to everyone who has helped us test this thing out!
