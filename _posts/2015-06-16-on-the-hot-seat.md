    The first Q&A for Bright Canopy
  </p>
</div>

Not long after Bright Canopy Founder, Bill Glover announced that he was going to step up and accept the challenge of providing Second Life Residents a way to use and view Second Life and its beautiful details without the financial burden of expensive machines, he hosted a Question and Answer Session where he sat on the hot seat and addressed questions and concerns about Bright Canopy. He answered questions about how the beta, pre-launch (early preview) and the launch were going to work. He also answered questions about important things like money (how much the service is going to cost) and whether or not Bright Canopy would have servers outside the US.

There was a great turnout for the Q&A, but there was a limit on the number of avatars that could attend because the event was hosted on a shared parcel.

Well, it&#8217;s time to put Founder Bill (SL &#8211; Chaos Priestman) back on the Hot Seat and let him answer to current and potential users of Bright Canopy. This time Bright Canopy will host two separate Q&A sessions to reach a broader audience and make it more convenient for US based and those based outside the US. It will also be hosted on Bright Canopy&#8217;s very own Island so that more users may attend.

**What**: Q&A Session with Bright Canopy Founder, Bill Glover (Chaos Priestman)
  
**When**: Wednesday, June 17th at 11AM SLT and again at 4PM SLT
  
**Where**: The meeting hall on Bright Canopy Island, [Bright Canopy(150, 225, 24)](http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Bright%20Canopy/150/225/24)
  
**Why**: For Bright Canopy Users and Bright Canopy Curious to ask ALL their questions.
