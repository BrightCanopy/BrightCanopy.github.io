[Sign-up at BrightCanopy.com](http://blog.brightcanopy.com)

Beta test is done.

Pre Release is over.

What comes next?

After much work and preparation and tremendous help from the community testing our offering, we are proud to announce the launch of the full Bright Canopy service.

**LAUNCH DATE**: August 29th

**EARLY BIRD PRICE**: $17 per month*

**BRINGÂ A FRIEND:** Sign-up a friend and both you, and your friend, earn free time.

**EAST COAST CLOUD:** We will also be adding a brand-new, US. East Coast cloud, for faster ping times!

We want to focus on service during launch, but we **will** be having a launch party to celebrate once the dust settles. You can look forward to music fun and special give-aways.

* _Our early bird price is going to be an experiment for 90 days. If you&#8217;ve been following the blog, you know we&#8217;ve seen price fluctuations on the back end, and we still need to watch actual usage of the service. $17 is a sustainable price if the instance costs return to their typical, historical values. It is not a sustainable price with the current spike in instance price. We may need to get creative with how we split instances, or we may need to raise prices. We intend to remain transparent as always and will keep you posted. Our goal is to continue to maintain a sustainable, affordable service._
