For years I have had a high appreciation for art. I enjoy going to art sales and shows, craft fairs, street fairs featuring art, museums, galleries, restaurants with interesting art. I enjoy it all. We have even accumulated quite a nice collection of art from artists local to our area in Northern California. I have also enjoyed art in SL over the years. I enjoy the photos people take in RL and SL and turn them into wall art for exhibits and sale. I enjoy the 3D sculptures. I have also enjoyed the larger art instalments that are housed on whole sims and regions in SL. However, for the last few years, I have missed out on so much of the art because, yet again, my computer and graphics card just wasn&#8217;t beefy enough to handle it. I would teleport into a region and experience a few pretty things surrounded by massive gray blobs and no detail. I was a sad, sad avatar.

Bright Canopy changes all of that. I have said it before, I am a customer. This week I was able to get out and explore two interesting art instalments. They were each unique in their style and approach. They were each detail rich and had so much to see. I didn&#8217;t cover all of either, but intend to go back and visit to experience more. Below are snapshots taken during my visits. (Both of these exhibits have been featured in other blogs, but rather than borrow content, I wanted to take a few shots of my own. I am enjoying [taking a few pictures](http://blog.brightcanopy.com/2015/07/04/losing-it/) using Bright Canopy.)

A note before I share the snapshots. I also learned this week about the Linden Endowment for the Arts. I feel like I am a bit late to the party again, but at both Dreamers and The Egg I saw LEA signs. Visit the [LEA](http://lindenarts.blogspot.com/) site to learn more.

A few of the dreams:
