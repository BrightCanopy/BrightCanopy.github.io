Thanks to Ramesh Ramloll of [DeepSophmore LLC](http://www.deepsemaphore.com/) for posting this!

Cool video of showing off some very useful sim control and object library tools for Open Sim, and all while running under Bright Canopy!

On the voice issue Ramesh encountered, I think that&#8217;s just an interaction between the video and voice capture and our own microphone support. Voice should normally work fine on Chrome out of the box. I just did a quick test to make sure and it seemed to be working for me.

This already makes me want to go build a new Sim.
