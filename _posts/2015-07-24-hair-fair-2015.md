It&#8217;s that time again SLers! Hair Fair is here. Sims and Sims of glorious new hair, realistic, edgy and beyond. I confess I do love to shop in SL and things like Hair Fair really feed that retail therapy bug. However, for the last several years I have avoided Hair Fair. (Insert sad face here.) Why? Simply because my laptop could not handle the graphics and the very busy sims. It would either completely lag out or I couldn&#8217;t see any of the hair because nothing would rez. (Insert second sad face here.)

Last night that all changed! I logged in using Bright Canopy and went straight to Hair Fair. I was stunned at the difference. The lag was tolerable&#8211;the only effect I noticed was sometimes it would take me a little longer to walk from point A to point B. Everything rezzed quickly and beautifully. Best of all, the $L had no trouble flying out of my pockets and into the accounts of the talented designers. Side benefit&#8211;donations being made to _Wigs for Kids_.

Here are some pictures of my new hair purchases. We would love to see your photos from Hair Fair. You can shareÂ them in the Flickr Group: [Bright Canopy Flickr Group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/2824436@N25/)
