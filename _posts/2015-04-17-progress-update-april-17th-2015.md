It is now a week since work started on developing a means to provide streamed access to Second Life and OpenSim, and we&#8217;ve received some really good coverage in that time from bloggers and through social media.

This is a very short update to bring people up-to-speed on where we are and where we&#8217;re going.

Right now we have a core team of beta testers from both Second Life and OpenSim, supported by the folks at <a href="https://www.fra.me/" target="_blank">Frame</a>, who are providing the means to manage and provision the service. Work is progressing well, and bugs and issues are being addressed &#8211; we&#8217;ve had a fair few to get sorted, and some still need additional effort to completely resolve.

Our next priority is to get a pre-launch beta up and running. This will be focused on using Chrome Browser, and accessing Bright Canopy from desktopÂ  / laptop systems. The aim of this pre-launch beta will be to open the service to a wider number of users to help us identify any remaining issues and bugs which may need fixing, and to confirm what has been put in place can work as a sustainable, scalable service.

Following the beta, we&#8217;ll be focusing on addressing any issues which may have arisen, and ensuring the service works with other web browsers as well. Once we&#8217;ve achieved this, we&#8217;ll be ready to officially launch the service, again initially on desktop and laptop systems. We do plan to support iPad and Android tablets in the future, but there is a lot of additional work to be done first, so these will be added to the service down the road.

In the week since this project started, we&#8217;ve had a phenomenal amount of interest shown in the work, so much so that we&#8217;ve had to close registrations for the pre-launch beta. Thank you to everyone who has signed up, and we&#8217;ll be letting you know when things are ready to go.

If you did miss out on the opportunity to join the pre-launch beta, you can <a title="Bright Canopy" href="http://blog.brightcanopy.com/" target="_blank">still sign-up for the launch</a>, and can again keep track of our progress through these pages and through our social media channels (below).
