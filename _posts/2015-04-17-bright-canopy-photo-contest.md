    Willow Dion&#8217;s photo sparked an idea for a competition
  </p>
</div>

We&#8217;re only a week old and already we&#8217;re running a competition!

The idea came to us thanks to Willow Dion, who used her very first Tweet to offer her best wishes to us:

[<img class="wp-image-43 size-full" src="http://blog.brightcanopy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/willow-tweet.jpg" alt="willow-tweet" width="575" height="83" />](http://blog.brightcanopy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/willow-tweet.jpg)

Willow&#8217;s tweet included a photo (seen at the top of this article), and got us thinking. We need a background image for the Bright Canopy desktop &#8211; so why not ask all of you interested in the service to submit an image you think we might like to use?

By way of encouragement, we&#8217;re offering a free month&#8217;s subscription to the service when we officially launch.

Interested? Then here&#8217;s what you need to do:

  * Take a high-resolution, in-world snapshot (<span class="message_content">2000&#215;1378</span> or larger) of a scene of location you like &#8211; please keep it PG and without any nudity!
  * Send your image to us in **one** of the following ways: 
      * Via a Tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/BrightCanopyApp" target="_blank">BrightCanopyApp</a> &#8211; make sure you follow us as well.
      * Via a G+ message to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+Brightcanopy/posts" target="_blank">Bright Canopy</a> &#8211; make sure you follow us as well.
      * Via our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BrightCanopy" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> &#8211; and by liking us as well.
  * Whichever option you use, be sure to include the hashtag #SLFreedom to let us know it&#8217;s a competition entry!
  * Images must be submitted by one of these three channels no later than 11:59 pm PDT on Friday, May 24th, 2015.

We&#8217;ll select the image we really like, and will use it as the desktop background people will see when they log-in to the service ready to launch the viewer. In return, the person submitting the selected image will get a free month&#8217;s use of Bright Canopy once we&#8217;ve officially launched!

When submitting your photo, please keep in mind:

  * We&#8217;re looking for images that will make a good desktop background &#8211; so things like in-world landscape pictures are good. Avatars can be included, but shouldn&#8217;t be the primary focus (so not portraits or similar, please!).
  * The submitted image must not contain material that violates or infringes another’s rights, including but not limited to privacy, publicity or intellectual property rights, or that constitutes copyright infringement. Nor can it include brand names or trademarks.
  * <span class="message_content"> Entry constitutes your consent to give Bright Canopy a royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, create derivative works from, and display the image in whole or in part, on a worldwide basis, in any form, media or technology now known or later developed, including for promotional or marketing purposes, except where prohibited by law.</span>

We look forward to seeing your entries!
