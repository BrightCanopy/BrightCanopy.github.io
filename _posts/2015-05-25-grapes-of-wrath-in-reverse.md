Now the Journey begins in earnest.  All of our earliest adopters are now able to try out Bright Canopy and help us make it better. This means we can literally, move on to the next steps in building a great company to serve you better.

As you may know, while we&#8217;ve been building the pre launch and preview, we&#8217;ve been packing and preparing for our big move. Our families, cheap Internet service and BBQ all happen to be in Texas, so we&#8217;re leaving our home in Grass Valley, Callifornia (near Lake Tahoe), to move to Amarillo. During the move we may be slightly delayed, but only slightly, getting back to you on support requests. It&#8217;s 2015 and 4G and coffee shops mean we won&#8217;t ever be very far away from you, and the Folks at [Frame](https://fra.me "Frame") are also right on top of things.

Watch Facebook, Twitter and G+ for updates as we make our way backwards along the route taken by Dustbowl refugees in the 1930s as they escaped a massive drought in the Midwest. These days it&#8217;s California with the drought and Texas is about to wash away. Funny how history rhymes.

June 1st we will be founding our company officially in Texas and will be full-time on Bright Canopy once again.

Thank your for your patience and support.
