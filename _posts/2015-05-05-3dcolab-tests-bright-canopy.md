Thank you to Stiofain MacTomais of <a title="3D Colab" href="http://3dcolab.com" target="_blank">3dColab.com</a> who shares this video of his experience testing Bright Canopy with OpenSim.

For those who haven&#8217;t had a chance to see the client yet. In this video, you can see the <a title="Frame Website" href="https://fra.me" target="_blank">Frame</a> controls along the bottom of the screen.  On the left is the gear control where you can chose to quit, the network indicator where you can monitor your connection or click to remeasure, the pingtime indicator and the distance to the server. In this case Stiofain is a long way from our beta server in California.

On the bottom right, you can see the control for selecting the keyboard and language, the upload control, cut and paste, DropBox and Google Drive integration and the full screen control.

Seeing this was especially great for us here at Bright Canopy since it allows us to compare performance with what we see here much closer to the beta server hosting. We do plan to host servers all over the world, but it&#8217;s great to see that things still work very well with a server thousands of miles away.
