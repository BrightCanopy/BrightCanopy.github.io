**SERVICE NOTICE: Update On The Time Credit Issue**

We are working on an issue related to crediting purchased time to an account. This has effected two residents. The payments themselves went fine and the credit will be applied properly as soon as this issue is resolved. This is a bug in some very new code that we deployed for the first time Tuesday. We will keep you updated, but don&#8217;t expect to see a fix until after Monday, since that is a US holiday, and we don&#8217;t want a rushed fix for something that effects your time balance. We will continue to hold-off on new invitations in the meantime to keep things manageable.

Thank you for your patience.

Bill
