<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bright Canopy is back!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bright Canopy has been down now for almost a month. We have done our best to be transparent and communicative during the downtime. Please be sure to read the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">community meeting transcript</span>](http://blog.brightcanopy.com/2015/09/05/community-meeting-transcript/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">for all of the details.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been working with Frame on a new pricing plan that will allow us to offer the service immediately. We will continue working on options that will improve our costs on the backend and allow more  flexibility in the future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, this is what we have:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">$17 per month includes 20 hours of service.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional time $0.02 per minute</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">30 minute minimum for sessions </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use 10 hours or more of additional minutes, that will be charged immediately, otherwise additional minutes are charged at the beginning of the next month.</span>

Since this is a fresh start, everyone will need to register at [brightcanopy.com](https://www.brightcanopy.com) even if you already had an account in pre release or beta.

**How it Works**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you sign up for Bright Canopy, you will be charged $17. You will receive 20 hours of server time. Once you have used that time, if you continue to use the service, you will build-up overage time at $0.02 per minute with a minimum purchase of 30 minutes ($0.60). If you use less than 10 more hours, your card will be charged for those additional minutes (plus the $17 for the new month’s subscription) at the beginning of the next month. If you use 10 or more hours of additional minutes before the end of the month, those minutes will be charged immediately.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you use 5 additional hours during the month, you would spend $6 more . This would mean your credit card would be charged $21 at the beginning of the next month.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use 10 additional hours, you would be charged $12 now and $17 for your monthly subscription at the beginning of the next month.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is our sincere hope that our community will find value in what we offer and are able to use the service to enhance their time in their virtual worlds. We look forward to being of service to you.</span>
