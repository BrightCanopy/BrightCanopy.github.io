Bright Canopy launched the pre release version of our service Tuesday, with a party at the new Bright Canopy island.

We were a crowd of people from places as far apart as Scotland and Japan.

We danced to toe tapping tunes courtesy of [G. Winz](https://twitter.com/gwinztanley "G Winz Twitter") and we all wore strange hats (thanks to [Xerxes Simondi](https://my.secondlife.com/xerxes.sismondi "Xerxes Sismondi SL") of [Drama Libre](http://www.dramalibre.com/ "Drama Libre SL")).

Much fun was had by all.

Inviting more people into the service helped us learn a few things and [Frame](https://fra.me "Frame") spotted a performance issue which they resolved in just a few hours yesterday. Now we&#8217;re seeing performance as good as we saw in the first Beta, but with many more features.

But what if you weren&#8217;t in the first group?

Don&#8217;t fret, Bright Canopy has you covered.

With the help of all of the brave souls who were first-in, we have now answered enough questions that we can open up the pre release for more people. We will be inviting people from the launch VIP list in groups of 25 and will continue to do that while we work on the features targeted for the public Launch. If you haven&#8217;t signed-up there is still time. [Bright Canopy VIP Launch List](http://blog.brightcanopy.com "Bright Canopy VIP Launch List")

Meanwhile we will be working on providing:

  * A monthly plan
  * Support for more keyboards in more languages
  * Hosting in more regions

After launch, we will continue to work to bring:

  * More Payment Options (Bitcoin, Lindens)
  * Mobile Support (multi-touch viewer support)

Right now we are working on support materials <del>and finishing touches on the first version of the production website</del>. We will be sending invitations to the first group of 25 very soon.

_Edit: We&#8217;ve heard your requests and are going to wait on the production website and focus on getting invitations out so people can try the pre release instead._
