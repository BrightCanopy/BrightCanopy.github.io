Thanks to a great suggestion from Second Life Resident and Bright Canopy user/group member Laurent Bechir, we now have a Flikr Group. If you use Bright Canopy to take photos in Second Life or another virtual world, please share them: [Bright Canopy Flickr Group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/2824436@N25/)

So far we have a few beginner photos that I (Jerri/Beth) have taken and a number of stunning photos taken by Second Life Resident Jo Yardley at the May Day Riots in 1920&#8217;s Berlin Project. Here is one of our favorites. Be sure to click through to the original, it really shows great detail in the clouds and the shadows on the street. Thanks Jo!
