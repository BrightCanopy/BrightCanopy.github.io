As promised Bright Canopy hosted its second Q&A Session on June 17th. The transcript is below. While Bill/Chaos was able to survive the Hot Seat&#8211;it did change him from Founder to&#8230; Kitchen Appliance. How? Why? Read the transcript.

Thanks for reading and stay tuned for the next announcement. There&#8217;s dancing involved!

[15:53] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Hello, folks.

[15:54] laben Core: hi chaos

[15:54] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Hi, Laben.

[15:55] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Hello Inara.

[15:55] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Welcome back Nariko.

[15:55] Inara Pey: Hi, folks!

[15:56] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Beth will be a bit late arriving, RL stuff.

[15:56] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Welcome, Warren

[15:56] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Hi, Vlad.

[15:57] Chaos (chaos.priestman): We&#8217;ll give it a few minutes for folks to arrive.

[15:57] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): :•.•:\*¨\* 今日は  \*¨¨\*:•. &#8220;hello&#8221;

[15:57] Vlad  Drakul-Dragonash (vladimirdraculaiii): Hello Chaos

[15:58] Chaos (chaos.priestman): I need to come up with something for the big glowing sign to do.

[15:58] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Programmer&#8217;s disease. I want to script everything.

[15:58] ωarren Cobain (warrenretro): everything is better with scripts

[15:58] Chaos (chaos.priestman) smiles

[15:58] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Exactly

[15:59] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): Everything Tastes Better&#8230; .. ON A STICK!!

[15:59] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): Muhahaha!

[15:59] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): laughs evilly!

[15:59] Chaos (chaos.priestman): heh

[15:59] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): WAFFLE!&#8230; ON A STICK!!

[15:59] ωarren Cobain (warrenretro): out side and on a stick

[15:59] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato):  \☺/ LOL  \☺/

[16:00] Chaos (chaos.priestman): and apparently deepfried

[16:01] ωarren Cobain (warrenretro): yaaa for deepfried

[16:01] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22) entered the region (2.86 m).

[16:01] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): DEEP FRIED!!!!

[16:01] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Welcome, Vanna

[16:01] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): \`hi guys!

[16:01] Inara Pey feels her arteries hardening at the words, &#8220;deep fried&#8230;&#8221; &#8230; ☻

[16:01] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): gr8 to be here

[16:02] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): WRAPPED IN BACON!!!

[16:02] Noir Soir entered the region (11.63 m).

[16:02] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Everyone have a copy of the guidelines? it&#8217;s not as big a deal tonight as some nights.

[16:02] ωarren Cobain (warrenretro): and on a stick

[16:02] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Welcome Noir!

[16:03] Chaos (chaos.priestman): but it does help everyone to have their say.

[16:04] Chaos (chaos.priestman): alright, I think we&#8217;re ready to start.

[16:04] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Thank you for coming to our second Bright Canopy Q&A session. We&#8217;ve covered alot of ground since the last Q&A, and I will give you a quick status report on that, but this is your session, not mine, so I will keep it brief.

[16:05] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Last time we met we were still in the Beta, working on the core functionality. I&#8217;m pleased to say were able to complete Beta with a working service in just a couple of weeks.

[16:05] Chaos (chaos.priestman): After Beta, we added more features and were able to open the service to more people for a pre release preview. In this preview we have been testing scaling, billing and profiling the overall service usage. We&#8217;ve found bugs and fixed bugs and still have some rough edges, some of them very frustrating.

[16:05] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Most notably we have been having some issues with handling error conditions, delaying billing until a session is really useful, and in shutting down sessions, but overall things have gone relatively well.

[16:05] Chaos (chaos.priestman): And I can add that as of today, we finally have a tool to refund time. Thank you Frame!

[16:06] Chaos (chaos.priestman): We&#8217;ve learned quite a bit about what it will take to bring this service to launch and are close enough to have confidence that what issues remain can be solved.

[16:06] Chaos (chaos.priestman): This last week, we also brought a complete, new service cloud online in Dublin Ireland. This is now providing much closer instances for Europe, West Asia and Africa. This won&#8217;t be the last new cloud we bring online, but it is a good start. Right now, about 70% of the residents who migrated have activated their new accounts.

[16:06] Chaos (chaos.priestman): A little more actually, now.

[16:06] Chaos (chaos.priestman): We&#8217;re holding on until the close of business today, SLT, to catch the stragglers, then Frame will begin distributing the time credit from their California accounts. Expect that to be complete by close of business, SLT, tomorrow.

[16:07] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Now, we can get to the purpose of getting together, your questions, observations and suggestions. You will have received a notecard with some guidelines, Those are just some basic rules to help everyone get a chance to ask their question. We will also be keeping a transcript and publishing to the blog as we did last time.

[16:07] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Please stand if you have a question and wait for me to call on you. You can also IM Beth if you have a question, but do not want to ask it in public chat.

[16:07] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Although, nope.

[16:07] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Beth still can&#8217;t make it.

[16:07] Chaos (chaos.priestman): so just IM me then.

[16:07] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Any questions?

[16:08] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Yes, India?

[16:08] ⒹⒿ Įŋdįą Dęɭɠądǫ (india.umia): how close are you to full launch?

[16:08] Chaos (chaos.priestman): That&#8217;s the big question isn&#8217;t it. It depends on what we insist on for full launch. We&#8217;ve decided that this will include a monthly plan and hosting in at least SFO and Dublin

[16:09] Chaos (chaos.priestman): so we&#8217;re half way there in that sense.

[16:09] Chaos (chaos.priestman): But we also need these bugs resolved

[16:09] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Welcome folkes.

[16:09] Chaos (chaos.priestman): So I can&#8217;t give you an exact date, but I can say weeks not months.

[16:09] ⒹⒿ Įŋdįą Dęɭɠądǫ (india.umia): ok ty

[16:10] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Any other questions?

[16:10] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Vlad?

[16:10] Vlad  Drakul-Dragonash (vladimirdraculaiii): I do have a question but i think Vana was floating first

[16:10] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Oh I&#8217;m sorry I see her seated.

[16:10] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Vanna?

[16:10] Vlad  Drakul-Dragonash (vladimirdraculaiii): oops i mean Nariko

[16:11] Noir Soir: giggles

[16:11] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Ah. Nariko? Do you have a question?

[16:11] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): YESH

[16:11] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): what made you decide on using the chrone browser over the others to test BC with?

[16:12] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): chrome*

[16:12] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Chrome was the most standards compliant for websockets, but it was really a bit of a coin toss. It&#8217;s the first one we had sound support for.

[16:13] Chaos (chaos.priestman): We will eventually fully support Chrome, Firefox and Safari

[16:13] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Maybe Spartan someday, but that remains to be seen.

[16:13] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): Ooh&#8230;

[16:13] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): 有難う 御座います  &#8220;ty&#8221;

[16:13] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Thank you for asking.

[16:13] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Vlad? You had a question?

[16:14] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Hi Molly

[16:14] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Hi Yar

[16:14] YAR (m7yarwood): hello

[16:14] Vlad  Drakul-Dragonash (vladimirdraculaiii): yes you mentioned that for full launch you will have a monthly plan. do you have any idea what that might run? I have a few friends that want to use BC but can not because by the hour is to costly

[16:14] Beth (bethsael.robbiani): Welcome Molly and Yar. Please have a seat when you rez. Read the notecard for further details.

[16:15] Molly Cyrus (mollywollidoodle): Chaos and Beth! i bring you cake for all the troubles i been causing!

[16:15] Molly Cyrus (mollywollidoodle): Ⓗⓘⓨⓐ

[16:15] Chaos (chaos.priestman) nods I know how important it is for this to be affordable. We are still negotiating some things on the backend, but It will be reasonable.  I can say it won&#8217;t be $5 and it won&#8217;t be $30

[16:15] Vlad  Drakul-Dragonash (vladimirdraculaiii): so somewhere between then

[16:15] Beth (bethsael.robbiani) grins Thank you Molly. Chaos is answering questions

[16:16] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): -RAISES HAND-

[16:16] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Yes, I&#8217;m sorry to be vague, but I really need some answers first.

[16:16] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): Sorry IDK where I am standing. SL is refusing to rezz for me

[16:16] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Yes Vanna?

[16:16] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): yes

[16:17] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): estimated date to pya with Lindens?

[16:17] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): *pay

[16:17] Molly Cyrus (mollywollidoodle) raises hand

[16:17] Chaos (chaos.priestman): I don&#8217;t have a specific date for that either, since I can&#8217;t do it alone. I&#8217;ll have to cooperate with three entities to make it happen.

[16:17] eddie (eddie.moonwinder): waves hi to everyone, even though nt yet rezzed from here

[16:18] Chaos (chaos.priestman): And there&#8217;s quite a bit of coding involved.

[16:18] Chaos (chaos.priestman): And funding necessary.

[16:18] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma) riases his hand

[16:18] Chaos (chaos.priestman): But it will have to be sometime after launch, not before.

[16:18] Chaos (chaos.priestman): For those reasons.

[16:18] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): Thanks

[16:18] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Thanks for asking. I know it&#8217;s a question on most people&#8217;s mind and it&#8217;s something I very much want to offer.

[16:18] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Laben

[16:18] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Then Molly

[16:18] laben Core: is it possible to work out how many subscribers you need to get it to the $10 price point per month? Also, any plans for an east coast server for us in the great white north?

[16:19] Chaos (chaos.priestman): We do plan an east coast cloud. It will probably be in North Virgnia because of the specific resources we need.

[16:20] Chaos (chaos.priestman): The number of users isn&#8217;t quite what drives our price down. It&#8217;s the availability of inexpensive compute resources.

[16:20] ⒹⒿ Įŋdįą Dęɭɠądǫ (india.umia): \o/ for n. va

[16:20] Chaos (chaos.priestman): I don&#8217;t think anyone has demonstrated that $10 will work.

[16:20] Chaos (chaos.priestman): But it would certainly be a popular price point and I won&#8217;t discount it

[16:20] Beth (bethsael.robbiani) smiles at India

[16:21] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): -RAISES HAND-

[16:21] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Molly?

[16:21] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma) raises his hand again

[16:21] Molly Cyrus (mollywollidoodle): Oh. haii! lol i was wondering bout chat logs&#8230; i seem to loose mine

[16:21] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Then Vanna, then Drew

[16:22] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Hmm you definitely shouldn&#8217;t Was this after your wedged session?

[16:22] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): can you see the total users logged at any given time, and is the response what you expected?

[16:22] Beth (bethsael.robbiani): You may also IM me your questions and then can feed them to Chaos.

[16:22] Chaos (chaos.priestman): So no. You shouldn&#8217;t lose them. There is a support issue for a lost config that we may need to add you to.

[16:22] Molly Cyrus (mollywollidoodle): nah it happens a lot. i will keep track of when. but like eddie with the loosing of prefs it seems to be more frequent the IM log goes

[16:23] Molly Cyrus (mollywollidoodle): okies..

[16:23] eddie (eddie.moonwinder): nods in agreement

[16:23] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Yes Vanna, I can see who&#8217;s logged in at any given moment.

[16:23] Molly Cyrus (mollywollidoodle) hops on all of Chaos&#8217; naughty list! lol

[16:23] Chaos (chaos.priestman): but not your Avatar names or anything you do in SL

[16:23] Chaos (chaos.priestman): only that you are connected to the servers.

[16:24] Chaos (chaos.priestman): The response has been good. Retention has been, I would say, decent, Great considering the rough edges.

[16:24] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): Thanks!

[16:24] Tony V (welshvapour): raises slinkie hand

[16:24] Chaos (chaos.priestman): we have a little under 800 people interested and a little under 200 who are actually using the service. edit: and about 60 power users.

[16:24] Ali V (alisadexter): lol

[16:24] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Drew?

[16:24] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Then Tony

[16:25] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): Ok I got two things&#8230;

[16:25] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): First

[16:25] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): Will there be any chance of a referal program&#8230; Like if you refer a friend and they buy time in the program you get some free minutes or something?

[16:26] Chaos (chaos.priestman): I would love to offer that today, but we will need to build it.

[16:26] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): you think thats a good idea?

[16:26] Chaos (chaos.priestman): And more importantly, I want this service solid enough you feel good about referring it. If you love it. It&#8217;s ready.

[16:26] Chaos (chaos.priestman): It worked for Dropbox.

[16:27] eddie (eddie.moonwinder): applauds

[16:27] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): and my other issue is with this

[16:27] Beth (bethsael.robbiani) smiles

[16:27] Chaos (chaos.priestman): But seriously, it&#8217;s a good idea, but only when it&#8217;s very polished and ready.

[16:27] Chaos (chaos.priestman): India after Tony

[16:27] Beth (bethsael.robbiani): In the que are questions from India and Nariko.

[16:27] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): with smaller avatars sometimes you need to use the advanced settings to change camera angle

[16:27] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Thank you

[16:28] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): ATM BC does not remember these settings

[16:28] Tony V (welshvapour): just throw a shoe at me when you&#8217;re ready Chaos.

[16:28] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): is this a known issue?

[16:29] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Nope. That should work. Please visit, help.brightcanopy.com and file a support request. We tested that earlier and it was working, so there may be something up.

[16:29] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): ok

[16:29] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Tony?

[16:29] Tony V (welshvapour): you mentioned the other day in group chat, sessions left running used up a buffer at the Irish server, stopping some logging on, how likely going forward is that to occur the more end users you attract?

[16:29] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Hopefully not at all. It&#8217;s a bug.

[16:29] Chaos (chaos.priestman): We should be able to handle many thousands of users right now.

[16:30] Tony V (welshvapour): nice and easy! and reassuring, thank you

[16:30] Chaos (chaos.priestman): India has a question about latency.

[16:30] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Do you mind if I paste it to chat, India?

[16:31] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Or I can just summarize.

[16:31] Chaos (chaos.priestman): What to do about unexpected latency.

[16:31] ⒹⒿ Įŋdįą Dęɭɠądǫ (india.umia): you can

[16:32] Chaos (chaos.priestman): India asks: ⒹⒿ Įŋdįą Dęɭɠądǫ (india.umia): i keep having latency issues with bc. i freeze so much and lost a lot of time because of it. i have verizon fios and i never run anything when im running sl but the freezing on bc and the per minute rate is so high i cant use the service. i dj on sl and i have several dj friends who need the service. we all had slgo so we could dj without lagging. hard to do with 50-70 people at our parties. idk how to fix the latency issues.

[16:33] Chaos (chaos.priestman): You&#8217;re a good distance from the California servers, so some latency makes sense, but you should still be able to use the system. Some things you can try are reducing the resolution (gray gear icon) this will not reduce your graphics settings in the viewer

[16:33] Chaos (chaos.priestman): you can also try Firefox instead of Chrome, but you won&#8217;t have sound. If you&#8217;re streaming as a DJ that may not be an issue anyway

[16:34] Neit Tackleberry is offline.

[16:34] ⒹⒿ Įŋdįą Dęɭɠądǫ (india.umia): i stream and play sl from different pc&#8217;s when i dj

[16:34] Chaos (chaos.priestman): The best answer will be when we open a new cloud closer to you, but that will be a little while. There&#8217;s a new tool in the works to make it easier to migrate.

[16:34] eddie (eddie.moonwinder) entered the region (6.30 m).

[16:35] ⒹⒿ Įŋdįą Dęɭɠądǫ (india.umia): ok ty

[16:35] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Nariko asks why a browser instead of  a native client.

[16:35] Neit Tackleberry is online.

[16:35] Chaos (chaos.priestman): The best answer is that it allows this to run almost everywhere from day one.

[16:35] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): Ooh&#8230;

[16:35] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Each native client will be a new programming effort.

[16:36] Chaos (chaos.priestman): but&#8230; Frame has native clients on the way. I&#8217;ve seen the OSX client and the iOS client

[16:36] Chaos (chaos.priestman): More to come.

[16:36] Noir Soir: {define native client please}

[16:36] Nariko 栄利花 (azusasato): okay

[16:36] Chaos (chaos.priestman): A program that runs on the computer itself not in the browser.

[16:36] Noir Soir: ty

[16:37] Chaos (chaos.priestman): It can greatly improve performance theoretically, but it adds some issues, like increased support cost and more weird compatibility problems.

[16:37] Molly Cyrus (mollywollidoodle) raises hand last time

[16:38] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Is Molly next? Am I missing anyone?

[16:38] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Ok, Molly?

[16:38] Molly Cyrus (mollywollidoodle): just about sound and voice.. i am having a shocker with that. sounds like i am badly remixing everynoe

[16:40] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Some sound breakup is expected but it shouldn&#8217;t be too bad. Voice is a headscratcher, we&#8217;ve had great results for some, not so great for others. That sounds like another good support request. I&#8217;d ask everyone, if something doesn&#8217;t seem right, report it. Even if it&#8217;s a known issue it helps to know how many people are seeing it.

[16:41] eddie (eddie.moonwinder): (excuses himself for another SL engagement. Thanks Team Canopy)

[16:41] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Thanks for coming, Eddie.

[16:41] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma) raises his hand

[16:41] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Any more questions?

[16:41] Beth (bethsael.robbiani): Thank you eddie. appreciate you being here and for your support.

[16:41] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Yes, Drew?

[16:41] Molly Cyrus (mollywollidoodle): okies. and yeh its kkinda more than some breaking up.. its gestures and all of it in one mega mix. ill contact support

[16:42] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): Would there be a discount for people if they advertised your service on their sim? Like&#8230;. ingame advertising?

[16:42] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): I know some services offer that

[16:42] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Hmm. Interesting idea. I don&#8217;t have a way to offer a discount today, but it&#8217;s worth discussion. Send me an email and we&#8217;ll keep it in mind. bill@brightcanopy.com

[16:43] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Any more questions?

[16:43] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): Cool. I like thinking of stuff like that that can help the user and the company like that

[16:43] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): yes

[16:43] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Vanna?

[16:44] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): is BC working &#8230;.LONDON?

[16:45] Chaos (chaos.priestman): If I understand your question. We have quite a few residents using it in London, and France and Ireland and Africa

[16:45] Chaos (chaos.priestman): well only two in Africa

[16:45] Tony V (welshvapour): lol

[16:45] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Alot of eastern europe

[16:45] Tony V (welshvapour): coughs, sorry.

[16:45] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): a friend does not know how to register, that&#8217;s why I asked&#8230;he&#8217;s in London

[16:45] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Just a long way for those folks. I&#8217;m hoping the future brings closer hosting on the continent for Africa

[16:46] Beth (bethsael.robbiani): Question from Noir in the que

[16:46] Chaos (chaos.priestman): All he has to do is go to www.brightcanopy.com and register, select Dublin as the closest city

[16:46] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Noir?

[16:46] Vanna St Laurent (halenna22): ty

[16:48] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Noir wanted to know how we are measuring up in adoption

[16:48] Chaos (chaos.priestman): compared to SlGo

[16:48] Chaos (chaos.priestman): As I understand their timeline we are doing very well. Inara, do you have a sense for what SlGo growth looked like in time and magnitude?

[16:49] Jordi Ellisson (lotato) entered the region (4.08 m).

[16:49] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Welcome Jordi

[16:49] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Inara may be otherwise engaged.

[16:50] Jordi Ellisson (lotato): gracias

[16:50] LOTATO Resident (Q-Translator es->en): thanks

[16:50] Chaos (chaos.priestman): I&#8217;ve spoken with several people involved and it seems we&#8217;ve had the benefit of their success a bit

[16:50] Inara Pey: Hi, sorry&#8230; few things going on in RL..

[16:50] Chaos (chaos.priestman): people already knew what this was.

[16:50] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): Chaos I sent you that email as requested

[16:50] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Sorry to put you on the spot Inara.Just thought you might know.

[16:50] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Thanks, Drew.

[16:50] Beth (bethsael.robbiani): Thank you Drew.

[16:50] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): NP

[16:50] Inara Pey: I&#8217;d say in terms of initial take-up BC is close to par with the ealry days of SL Go.

[16:51] Inara Pey: early*

[16:51] Chaos (chaos.priestman): Good to know. Thanks, Inara.

[16:51] ĎɾєƜ Vουցђt (drewtenma): Now we hope that sony does not try to buy up Bright Canopy \*GIGGLES\*
