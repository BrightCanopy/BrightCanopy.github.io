We are visiting Abilene, Texas this weekend to attend Jerri&#8217;s 30th High School Reunion. While there we made a visit to our attorney&#8217;s office and signed the documents to officially form Bright Canopy, LLC. The Secretary of State accepted the filing for Bright Canopy on June 16th, but there were still many documents to be signed to give the LLC life. That all happened this afternoon at the office of Chase and Walls, PLLC. Much thanks to Sam Chase and his staff for the great work.

A bit of background and trivia &#8211; Jerri worked for Sam about 20 years ago. She was a legal assistant with is firm for 3.5 years. She used to handle the very type of paperwork for clients that we signed for Bright Canopy, LLC. Jerri talks all the time about what a great mentor Sam was. He got her involved in the Abilene Jaycees (Jr. Chamber of Commerce) which allowed her to develop her leadership and speaking skills. Skills she has used throughout her professional career and continues to use in her work at Bright Canopy. It was great to be able to reminisce with Sam about the &#8220;good old days&#8221; while finalizing the documents.
