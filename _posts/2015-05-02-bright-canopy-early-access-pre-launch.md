Don&#8217;t buy that new graphics card!

It&#8217;s official.

Bright Canopy is completing our beta test and we can finally announce our invitation-only, early access Pre Launch will be Tuesday May 19th at noon SLT.

Those who signed up to help with Beta and Pre Launch should have already received your invitation. If you signed up and received confirmation for Beta or Pre Launch and did not receive your invitation, please contact <a title="Support" href="http://blog.brightcanopy.com/support/" target="_blank">Bright Canopy Support</a>.

If you missed Beta and Pre Launch and signed up for regular launch notification instead, don&#8217;t worry. We will be having a public launch very soon and it will be shiny and awesome because of all of the hard work we&#8217;ll put our <del>test subjects</del> Beta and Pre Launch folks through.

The purpose of this early access release is to learn how to properly serve our customers and manage the Bright Canopy network for maximum efficiency. This will be a full, working version of Bright Canopy with no limit on time, persistent user settings, Dropbox and Google Drive support, Cut and Paste and Ultra Graphics. Residents can refill hours as often as they like for less than one dollar (USD) per hour (or equivalent, more details on payment options coming soon). We will not be accepting Lindens for Pre Launch, but we hope to be at least testing Linden Payment by public launch.

Just a reminder, May 19th will be an early access release. We will not be offering monthly or free tiers for Pre Launch, but we will be learning how residents actually use the service to determine just what kind of payment options we can responsibly offer as we grow.

For Pre Launch, we will still be hosted in California, but watch for new deployments around the world very soon, possibly even before public launch.

We hope everyone who signed up will participate and help us build a great service, but it we have openings we will be sending additional invitations to people who signed up for launch notification, so be sure to [sign-up for launch](http://blog.brightcanopy.com/) notifications if you haven&#8217;t already.
