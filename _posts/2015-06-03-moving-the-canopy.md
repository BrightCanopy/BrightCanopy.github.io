We made it! We arrived at our final destination, Amarillo, TX, USA on Friday, May 29th. First stop in town was, of course, Cadillac Ranch. Texas gives our company a longer runway. It’s an inexpensive place to live and launch with plenty of high speed Internet. Think of Amarillo as Chiang Mai without the humidity. (Well, most of the time.)

We drove out of Grass Valley, CA, USA on Tuesday, May 26th. Our first visit would be to Sequoia National Park to see some really big trees. When we arrived we came in on the “dry side” of the park. After about 45 minutes of hair pin turns up the side of a mountain, we found the visitors center and the beginning of the big trees. Several hiking trails guided visitors past some of the largest living things on the planet. As we were on a time schedule, we walked one of the shorter trails, encountered some local wildlife and then drove down to see the King of the Trees – The General Sherman.

Once we left the park, we made our way to Bakersfield, CA where we bedded down for some much needed rest. The next morning we made our way to Williams, CA. Williams is on Historic Route 66. We stayed at The Grand Canyon Hotel which was a lovely restored historic building right on the Route. We indulged in some after-dinner cocktails at a local establishment and made friends with a visitor from Australia celebrating his 50th birthday in 50 days in the United States. Cheers to Craig!

The next morning we rose relatively early to drive out to see one of the Wonders of the World, The Grand Canyon. We wandered the south rim via hiking trails and shuttle buses. We encountered several mule deer who seemed quite accustomed to the human invasion of their habitat.

We left the Canyon mid-afternoon to make our way toward the last stay-over in Albuquerque, NM. While on the highway we saw signs for Meteor Crater. WHAT?! We just HAD to stop and check that out. We grabbed a quick snack at the snack bar at the Crater then ventured outside to see the massive hole.

While it put us further behind than we had anticipated, it was well worth the time we spent. We pushed on to Albuquerque, NM arriving at right around midnight. We slept in a bit the next morning. We found a great restaurant that served one of the local favorites, green chili, and had a nice lunch. With full bellies and an anxious spirit, we ventured toward Amarillo.

We encountered some interesting weather on the road to Amarillo. There is nothing quite like a thunderstorm in that area of the country. Rain, lightening, thunder, winds, difficult driving conditions at times, but quite a sight to behold.

After 5 hours on the road and a couple of stops, Cadillac Ranch welcomed us home.

Throughout the entirety of the trip we made frequent stops at coffee shops and restaurants for wifi and used 4G while on the road to provide continued support to our Bright Canopy customers. Bright Canopy remained our priority while taking in the sights and travels. We appreciate you being a part of this journey. We look forward to now having an even more laser-tight focus on you and Bright Canopy to grow it to the next stage. Please watch for our next big announcement COMING SOON!
