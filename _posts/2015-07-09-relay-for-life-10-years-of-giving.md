Next weekend, July 18 &#8211; 19, Second Life will hold it’s 10th Annual Relay for Life Event benefitting the American Cancer Society. The theme of this year’s Relay is “The Future is Now”.

Residents in Second Life participate in a variety of activities to raise funds for Relay for Life. Everything from placing kiosks in venues all across the grid to making items to sell and donating a portion of or all of the proceeds to the Relay cause. Next weekend Avatars will take turns walking a specially constructed track around the clock for the weekend in order to raise even more funds. It’s just like a “First Life/Real Life” Relay for Life except it is easier on your feet and legs. To date, the SL Relay for Life has raised over $2 Million US Dollars for the American Cancer Society. THAT’S A LOT OF LINDENS! You can get all the statistics from Relay for Life in Second Life here: [http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Relay\_For\_Life\_of\_Second_Life](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Relay_For_Life_of_Second_Life)  A full list of events can be found here: [http://www.relayforlifeofsecondlife.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main\_Page#2015\_RELAY\_FOR\_LIFE\_OF\_SECOND\_LIFE\_DATES\_TO\_REMEMBER](http://www.relayforlifeofsecondlife.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page#2015_RELAY_FOR_LIFE_OF_SECOND_LIFE_DATES_TO_REMEMBER)

I stopped by the American Cancer Society’s Sim in Second Life and took a few shots of some of things they done for this years event. One thing of particular interest to me are the luminaries you can “light” on the track when the Relay Trac Sim is officially opened. Luminaries can be lit in honor of or memory of someone for a donation of L$50 or more.  I will be purchasing luminaries in memory of:

Betty Murry

Julia Hernandez (SL: Madame Maracas)

Jill Scifres

I encourage you to enjoy Relay for Life and the associated events/sims with Bright Canopy. Don’t miss the beauty of these amazing works and important acts of love/support. Thanks to everyone who Relays and supports Relay!
