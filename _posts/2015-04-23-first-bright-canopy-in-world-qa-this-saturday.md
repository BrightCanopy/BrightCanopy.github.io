_We&#8217;re only missing you_

Please join us for our first in-world Q&A at our shiny new, Bright Canopy Meeting Hall.

**When**: Saturday, April 25th, 11:00am SLT
  
**Where**: http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Thorncliff/234/167/1201
  
**How This Works**: To make sure everyone gets a turn to ask their question, please take a seat when you arrive. When we get everyone settled, we will begin taking question. If you have a question, please stand and I will call on you. Please ask questions in text chat so that we can keep a transcript.

Please be aware that we will be keeping a log of the chat and will be posting it to the website. We respect your privacy, but want to share the discussion with people who can&#8217;t make it.
