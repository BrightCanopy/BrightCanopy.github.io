Written by Jerri (SL: Bethsael (Beth) Robbiani)

I have been in Second Life eight years and two months (3003 Days) according to my profile. During that time there have been a lot of changes and additions to SL. Some of these changes and additions I have been slower to adopt than others. This is mostly because I run a less expensive laptop that, frankly, does not rez some of the more demanding things like shadows, shading, shiny and mesh well on its own.

Enter Bright Canopy. Using Bright Canopy (yes I am one of our customers), I have been able to enter the world of….MESH! I can enjoy the details of the mesh clothing, hair, feet (I no longer look like I have feet associated with a much beloved prehistoric cartoon.) and shoes! Okay. I know I am a little late to the party, but give a girl a break.

One of the frustrations I encountered when first learning to use mesh was the alpha layers. I would “wear” one and it would knock off another that was attached to same spot. Then, when searching through note cards seeking help for the problem I saw it. The key. “ADD” the layer rather than “WEAR” the layer. Bingo! Now when you see me out and about in Second Life I will be sporting fancy new feet, shoes, clothes and hair. I am stylin’!

I haven’t made the leap to a mesh body yet. I am more than a little attached to my body and skin as they were special custom gifts given to me by an SL friend and creator. Maybe someday. For now though, I will stick to the Beth I know, buy her pretty new things to wear and ADD the alpha layers one on the other.
