by Chaos Priestman

Have you ever wrestled an octopus? I&#8217;m guessing that, considering our shared interest in virtual worlds, the chances are nonzero that someone reading this has. I&#8217;ve been wrestling a metaphorical octopus for over a year now. We&#8217;ve done amazing things both with Bright Canopy and the rest of Frame&#8217;s portfolio, but it&#8217;s the sort of fun where you hardly get a chance to look-up and look back. It hardly seems that  it&#8217;s been a year now. Anyway, that&#8217;s my excuse for being so terrible about posting. We&#8217;ve been busy building a bigger and better Bright Canopy.

And we have ALOT of new stuff.

**Increase Reliability and Performance**

The biggest change, the one that potentially effects everyone, has been the ongoing work to make the platform faster and more stable with lower bandwidth network connections. We can now operate with just a fraction of the network quality we previously required. Performance won&#8217;t be perfect on a poor connection, but it will be much, much better.

**Better Support**

The Frame Customer Success team has really jumped in and learned the nooks and crannies of supporting viewers.  You may even run into a few of them now and then in world.

**Singularity!**

As I announced on twitter a couple of months ago, we now also offer support for the Singularity viewer. It&#8217;s still newer than the others to running under Frame, so please let us know if you have any issues or questions.

**More Applications**

We have added quite a few apps that should be useful in-world and out: Blender, Gimp, Google Earth and Google&#8217;s new HDR Efex Pro.  Now you can run all of them on a Chromebook with Bright Canopy

**Upload / Download Support**

You can now upload and download to your running instance without using cloud storage. Just checkout the small arrow in the taskbar and save to the &#8220;Download Now&#8221; folder to try it.

**iOS Support**

Frame Terminal for iOS runs on your iPad and even iPhone (but it&#8217;s tiny on an iPhone, not much we can do there yet). Please try it out and let us know what you think. Just install it from the AppStore and login with your usual login. Note that we have several different mouse modes, so play with that to get the best results. We have microphone support in the works, so watch for that soon.

Both Frame and Bright Canopy have more on the way, so stay tuned.

See you in-world,

Chaos
