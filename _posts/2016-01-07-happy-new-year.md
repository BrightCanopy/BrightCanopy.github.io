Happy 2016! We hope you all enjoyed your holidays. The end of 2015 was a whirlwind of change and activity.

In early December we shared that Bill had joined the [FRAME](https://fra.me/) team and was going to be managing their virtual worlds and education products. He has been incredibly busy integrating into the company, meeting new customers and continuing to help with customer support for Bright Canopy on the more unique issues. The Customer Success Team has done a great job picking up the heavy lifting with Bright Canopy customer support.

On December 12th we celebrated the new relationship with [FRAME](https://fra.me/) with a party. We had a great time with DJ Magdalena Kamenev spinning tunes, dancing and gifts for the guests. We also enjoyed learning more about The International Spaceflight Museum and Drama Libre. These two groups provide great examples of what Second Life has to offer. [The International Spaceflight Museum](http://www.slispaceflightmuseum.org/) is a great educational region and [Drama Libre](http://www.dramalibre.com/home) hosts fun in-world dance parties every week complete with different themes and unique builds.

As the dust begins to settle a bit from the transition with [FRAME](https://fra.me/), we hope to return to more regular blog posts, social media engagement and watch for more fun events and community meetings.
