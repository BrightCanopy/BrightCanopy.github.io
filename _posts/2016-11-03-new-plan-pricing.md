Just a quick update on our new pricing plan.

All current members will continue with the same pricing you have now, as a thank you for being a part of Bright Canopy.

Starting Monday, November 7, new members will be on the new plan. The price remains the same at $17 per month, but the new plan will include 10 hours and each additional minute will be $0.03.

If you have any questions about the billing changes, please contact bill@fra.me.

If you have any other questions, or need help with your account please contact support@fra.me.
