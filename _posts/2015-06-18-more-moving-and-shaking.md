Today was moving day for Bright Canopy&#8211;again. We found a sweet co-working space at the WT Enterprise Center in Amarillo. We now have a great space with meeting facilities, wifi, coffee and even ping pong. Now we move forward!

That&#8217;s the moving&#8211;what about the shaking? The shaking happens this Saturday, 9AM SLT at the Bright Canopy Island. We are going to shake our avatar&#8217;s bottoms to the tunes provided by Ham Rambler, Mayor of Virtual Dublin. Why? You ask. To celebrate the migration of customers to the Dublin servers of course. Not only will we be celebrating the migration, but we will also be learning about Virtual Dublin and all Ham has going on over there. We hope you will join us.

Thanks for following our nomadic adventures over the last few weeks. We seem to be settled for the moment and looking forward to buckling down to work.
