We are starting to invite more people into the pre release preview version of Bright Canopy. The Pre Release has some nice features and runs well in a Chrome browser on Linux, Mac or Windows. It also works in Safari and Firefox, but we&#8217;re only supporting Chrome right now so we can focus on the experience.

What it won&#8217;t do is run on a phone or tablet, and there&#8217;s a reason for that. We understand how important mobile support will be, but the Second Life viewers don&#8217;t currently support multi touch. They were first created in a time when that wasn&#8217;t an issue, and there really hasn&#8217;t been a reason for them to add that feature until now.

Our plan is to create new skins and settings to allow the mainstream open source viewer to support multi touch and mobile. We will then use the the regular releases of the viewers with these features enabled. That way we won&#8217;t be off on an experimental branch and we can give back to the community.

I can&#8217;t give you a date when this will be enabled yet. We need to get the core functionality tested out and buy a little time to do development. I will keep you posted on progress along with the other things we&#8217;re working on for launch.
