Over the years, I&#8217;ve learned that nothing important happens in SL or OpenSim without a community effort. Bright Canopy has been lucky to have spectacular community support almost from the first day, and part of our responsibility as a member of that community is to be transparent and responsive.

Along with live Q&A sessions, I will also regularly provide updates here on the blog.

Here&#8217;s our journey, so far:

During Beta we worked with [Frame](https://fra.me "Frame"), our platform provider, to validate the core service. They generously provided their server time and development support, and we were able to prove that their platform can stream a viewer with ultra graphics settings through a Chrome browser window on a low end device, even a Chromebook. We also learned some of what we needed to know about the care and feeding a of a viewer, user sessions, graphics card support, international keyboard support etc. The demo works, and it works well.

Next we started working to build Bright Canopy into a sustainable service rather than a demo. We&#8217;re working on payments, metering and metrics now in advance of the Pre Launch which will test all of this out. More on that in a moment.

Meanwhile, we&#8217;ve been working with rights holders on licensing and IP questions and chasing down attorneys with four separate firms to find the best fit for Bright Canopy&#8217;s legal needs, and I think we&#8217;ve found a perfect fit. I also gave notice with my current employer. My wife and I are moving from Grass Valley, a resort area in the Sierra Nevadas near Lake Tahoe, to Amarillo, Texas on the 26th. We have family there and can live for much less. This allows us to work on Bright Canopy full time.

We also announced a date for Pre Launch, May 19th (although I attempted time travel with my first email about it).

So what is Pre Launch? Pre Launch is where we are going to prove not only that we can solve the technical problem, but that streaming virtual world viewers is a viable business. No one has proven this before. SLGo made a good run and maybe things could have turned out differently if they had more time, but they did not get a chance to prove that this could be a sustainable business. I think we can prove that.

We&#8217;re going to do that test in Pre Launch with an hourly fee set at less than one dollar (USD) per hour.

Why an hourly fee, why not monthly, and why that particular price?

Charging hourly serves two purposes, one is that we are charged hourly on the back end (ultimately by Amazon Web Services), and we have to pay the piper. Also this will allow residents to decide how much they want to spend in a very granular sort of way. You can buy hours and save them up and use them only when you need to, rather than paying, say $750/mo month and only using 20.

But why can&#8217;t we just charge $10 per month or even $50?

We may, but not yet. We can say for sure that the early access price is not going to be the same as what we have at launch. And folks that are in early access (Pre Launch) will get to take advantage of that discount when it happens, but we have to solve some equations first, and we don&#8217;t have the numbers to plug in. The way we (through Frame) buy server time on the backend is that we either buy time as needed (on demand), or we pay for months or a year in advance (reserved) or we bid on the open market for time (spot).

Spot instances are cheaper than reserved instances which are cheaper than on demand instances. Unfortunately, spot instances can also go away with two minutes warning if someone else outbids us and buys up all the available instances. There are strategies for managing all of this, bidding algorithms and mixed reserved/spot strategies etc, but they take constant tweaking and monitoring and it all depends on one question.

How much is unlimited? Really?

If we provide an unlimited plan, how many hours will people actually use? If everyone uses 750 hours per month. That monthly fee isn&#8217;t going to be cheap. If it&#8217;s 10 hours per month, then we&#8217;re already there, buying by the hour won&#8217;t cost you any more than a $10/month plan, and wih rollover it might even be a better deal.

That&#8217;s the numbers, but I have a cell phone, I know how plans with set minutes can be less attractive. It&#8217;s a gut, convenience thing, and I get that. It&#8217;s nice not having to think about it. But even today, if you want the best bang for your buck you buy a plan where you only [pay for what you use](https://ting.com/ "Ting").

So we are going to be actively working on our bidding strategies, avoiding adding any unnecessary overhead, and even working with Amazon to see if they can create more options that fit our needs better.

Price is the hardest thing we have left to solve, and it&#8217;s where we will work hardest. I appreciate the candor and civility in the discussion so far, I know it&#8217;s an emotional issue for all of us. I especially thank you for your patience while we grow Bright Canopy from a seed into a mighty larch.
