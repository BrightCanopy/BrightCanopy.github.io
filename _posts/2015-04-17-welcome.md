This is just a quick introduction to some of the things that will be going on here, and what you can expect to see.

First off, like the project itself, this blog is likely to be a work-in-progress for a while, so don&#8217;t be surprised if you see some changes during your initial visits. It is intended to be a part of a new overall site that is being put together for the project, but like all things, it will take a little time for us to pull all the threads together.

However, through these pages we&#8217;ll be bringing you all the latest news and information coming out of Bright Canopy, most likely with some random musings along the way! Of course, a blog wouldn&#8217;t be a blog without feedback &#8211; and we welcome yours. Do keep in mind, however, that at this point in time we&#8217;re not able to answer questions on things like launch dates, pricing, and so on. Rest assured, however, that we&#8217;ll be blogging and announcing these these just as soon as we&#8217;re in a position to do so.

As the website develops, so we&#8217;ll be providing a more formal means of accepting feedback such as bug reports, suggestions for possible improvements. For now, though, we really wanted to get the blog up and running to make sure you have a way of keeping tabs on what we&#8217;re doing.

It&#8217;s hard to believe that all this started just a week ago, and so much has already been achieved. There&#8217;s a lot more to comeÂ  &#8211; so in the meantime, welcome once again!
