**Here’s The Status**

  * We have had a tsunami of sign-ups, really incredible support and response, and for those who were able to get in, we’ve had great reports on the quality of the service.

  * We are not going to charge anyone, anything for this weekend. It’s free, gratis, thanks for trying it out. No cards have been charged at all.

  * We’ve had so much response that we are going to have to make a change and offer a different plan to make sure we are sustainable and can be around long enough to take advantage of much more affordable hosting options from Frame in a few months.

  * There will be a planned outage for 2 hours that will occur sometime between 6AM and 12pm SLT.

  * The outage will allow us to change direction. We will securely remove all accounts and payment information. This will solve some issues, and will give people a chance to see the new plan and connect to the closest cloud. We will then let everyone re-register from a clean slate.

**The Details**

As you know, a couple of weeks before we launched we saw a huge increase in our cost on the backend, but we had spreadsheets and plans about how, if things turned out right, we could build this out and keep it going while we work with Frame to build a way to host this much less expensively. The hosting options are in progress and look promising.

For launch,  we had a great response from the community and lots of people coming to try things out. We had so many people, in fact, that some of our assumptions started to bend and then break. Bright Canopy is a tiny startup with limited resources. Our aforementioned spreadsheets had not prepared us for the response we saw.

We burned through our contingency in a few hours. We tried modifying some things, but it just wasn’t something that could be fixed with a knob. We talked over our options and looked at the numbers. In order to be able to offer a service of any sort, we knew we would have to make changes.

There will be a limited time offer of a $10 credit for the first month, meaning the first month will be $7. This is our way of thanking you for bearing with us. This offer expires 12AM SLT on Sunday, September 6th. After that, each month will be $17. The plan comes with 20 hours, and additional time is available for $0.013 per minute.

This isn’t what we planned, and making the change is hard, but we believe it is the only way to keep this service available for the people who need it.

Thank you for your patience and support. If you have any questions or concerns please contact us at support@brightcanopy.com.
