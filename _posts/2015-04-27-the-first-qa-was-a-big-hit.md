The in-world Q&A was a big hit! We filled the Sim for a full hour. (We will have an island for the next meeting, so we can be better neighbors).

For folks who weren&#8217;t there, we had a lot of enthusiasm and great questions. One take-away is that people really need this service soon and they are willing to help however they can.

Our next big push is going to be setting up a pre-launch service. Everyone in the beta and pre-launch invitation list will be invited to use the service as actual customers and help us make it something we can all love. Once it&#8217;s great, we&#8217;ll open it up and let everyone in at a full-blown Launch party.

Inara will have a follow-on post on the meeting which will have more information.

Also we will be announcing the winner of the background contest soon!

Exciting times!

(I believe I have exhausted my allotment of exclamation points for the next week.)
