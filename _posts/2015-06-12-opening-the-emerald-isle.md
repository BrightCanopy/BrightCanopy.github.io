  It&#8217;s no blarney! Bright Canopy is migrating almost 100 residents to our new Ireland Cloud on Monday, June 15th! That means that Bright Canopy users in Europe, Western Asia, and Africa should see better performance since you will be closer to a server. It also means that users in these areas should NOT log in between the hours of 9AM and 9PM SLT because we will be migrating you all to that server. We apologize for that bit of inconvenience, and each user migrated will receive 2 additional hours of free credit for their trouble.
</p>

We will only be moving active residents, so if you have received a Bright Canopy invitation, but have never logged-in, please [contact support](http://help.brightcanopy.com) if you would like to be moved to the new Ireland cloud. This is only necessary if you have never logged into Bright Canopy as of today.

To celebrate, we will be hosting a party in Second Life on Saturday, June 20th at 9AM SLT. The Mayor of Dublin, in Second Life, Ham Rambler will be serving as our DJ and sharing information about virtual Dublin and all it has to offer.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Many of you know how important Dublin is to us as Bill and I met at The Blarney Stone on December 26, 2007 and have been together ever since. So we are super excited about this milestone.
